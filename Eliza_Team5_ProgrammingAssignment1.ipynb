    "###ELIZA is an AI chatbot developed by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 in the AI lab at MIT\n",
    "### It was created to converse in natural language by a computer. It is considered robo-pyschotherapist,\n",
    "### a machine acts as Doctor, making conversation with humans through interactive chat\n",
    "###\n",
    "###This motto of this assignment is creating a chatbot using Python that is similar to Eliza, \n",
    "### making interactive conversation with the users.\n",
    "###Some of the main features are as follows:\n",
    "###-- Greet the user initially and asks for his/her name\n",
    "###-- uses his/her name throught the conversation just like human-beings in natural language\n",
    "###-- Identifies the context of the conversation and responds appropriately\n",
    "###-- Greet the users at the end of the conversation\n",
    "#\n",
    "###Detailed features:\n",
    "###-- Transforms first/second person pronouns to make meaningful conversation\n",
    "###-- Identifies main context of the conversation by which problem of the user is identified and suggests reasonable solutions\n",
    "#\n",
    "###Additional features:\n",
    "###-- Identifies if the user uses curse/swear/bad words in his/her conversation and if any inappropriate content is found, it terminates the conversation\n",
    "###-- Uses EMOJIs or EMOTICONs to make the conversation more interactive wherever it is appropriate\n",
    "###-- If user is idle for certain amount of time, it reminds the user in a polite language whether he/she needs any help\n",
    "###-- If the user just enters blank messages, it helps the user understand how it works in natural language\n",
    "###-- Sentiment Analysis of user inputs and suggestions\n",
    "#\n",
    "###Algorithm:\n",
    "###1. Asks the user to enter his/her name\n",
    "###2. Fetch the name entered by the user. If user enters nothing, the default user name will be considered 'User'\n",
    "###3. When prompts for user name, if user remains idle for 50 seconds, it will remind the user to enter his/her name again\n",
    "###4. If the user enters some curse/bad words when asked for name, the conversation will be ended\n",
    "###5. Once, the user name is identified, it would ask what the user is looking for. It chooses a random response from the available responses to initiate the \n",
    "###   actual conversation. Also, it uses the username throughout the conevrsation to make it more lively and natural\n",
    "###6. A pool of patterns and responses are pre-defined. Depending upon the input provided by the user, it matches the patterns and \n",
    "###   responds to the user according to the context\n",
    "###7. If it identifies any first/second person pronouns, it makes appropriate transformations while responding\n",
    "###8. If the responses contain any text related to EMOJIs or EMOTICONs, it converts that text to EMOJIs using 'emoji' package in python\n",
    "###9. If the respinses contain curse/swear/bad words, it ends the conversation immediately with apt message\n",
    "##10. If user input contains any End conversation patterns like Bye, End, Quit, Exit, it ends the chat by responding to the user \n",
    "\n",
    "###Execution Flow:\n",
    "### 1.Starts at main()\n",
    "### 2.Invokes fetch_username() to identify the username and pass it as parameter to start_conv()\n",
    "### 3. Performs profanity check using verify_profanity() and fetch user name by identifying the patterns using find_specific_patterns() \n",
    "###    ---- Patterns to identify name   => [\"I'm\", \"name\",\"call me\", \"it's\"]\n",
    "###    ---- Trigger the timer if user is idle for 50secs and prompts a suitable message to remind him in the methods enter_text() and enter_name()\n",
    "###          --- enter_text() : during conversation    --- enter_name() : initial greeting when asked for user name\n",
    "### 4. Invokes interpret_userinput() to identify the context of the user conversation using Regex patterns in the response_pool dictionary\n",
    "### 5. Transforms First/Second person pronouns using firstPronoun_to_second_form() and first_pronouns_pool dictionary\n",
    "### 6. Ends the conversation when end/quit patterns are identifed. Patterns used to end: \n",
    "###    ---- end_conv_words = [r'.*(bye).*', r'.*(quit).*', r'.*(exit).*',  r'.*(end).*']   \n",
