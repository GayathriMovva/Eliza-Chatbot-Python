# Eliza-Chatbot-Python
Interactive chatbot using Python


######
ELIZA is an AI chatbot developed by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 in the AI lab at MIT
It was created to converse in natural language by a computer. It is considered robo-pyschotherapist,
a machine acts as Doctor, making conversation with humans through interactive chat

The motto of this project is creating a chatbot using Python that is similar to Eliza, 
making interactive conversation with the users.
Some of the main features are as follows:
1. Greet the user initially and asks for his/her name
2. Uses his/her name throught the conversation just like human-beings in natural language
3. Identifies the context of the conversation and responds appropriately
4. Greet the users at the end of the conversation
